# Marlin-Ender3Pro-Tuned
Welcome to my Marlin Repo :D

Here you will find customized Marlin config files and compiled .bin files for my Ender 3 Pro with BTT SKR Mini E3 V3.

To use these files, download Marlin's source code at https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin and replace the config files included with the ones from here.

Always use the correct version's config files. If you don't, the firmware won't compile and/or won't work properly!

I refuse any responsibility for damages to you or your property. Use these files at your own risk.
